# Enable GitHub Pages - Make Your Website Live!

Your website can be accessed online at: **https://renskie07.github.io/IAS-PROJECT-NEU/**

## Quick Setup Steps:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Go to your repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/renskie07/IAS-PROJECT-NEU

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Click on **"Settings"** tab (top right of repository)
   - Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
   - Under **"Source"**, select:
     - Branch: **`main`**
     - Folder: **`/ (root)`**
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **Wait a few minutes:**
   - GitHub will build your site (usually 1-2 minutes)
   - A green banner will appear with your site URL

4. **Access your website:**
   - Your site will be live at: **https://renskie07.github.io/IAS-PROJECT-NEU/**

### Option 2: Verify Your Files

Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory (it is! ✅)

## Testing Your Website

After enabling GitHub Pages:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to build
2. Visit: https://renskie07.github.io/IAS-PROJECT-NEU/
3. Your portfolio website should load!

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Error?** Wait a few more minutes, GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to build
- **Still not working?** Make sure:
  - The repository is set to Public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
  - The branch is set to `main`
  - The folder is set to `/ (root)`

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Later, you can add a custom domain in the Pages settings if you want!
