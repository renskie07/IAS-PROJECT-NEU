# 🌐 Make Your Website Live on GitHub Pages

Your website is already on GitHub! Now let's make it accessible in a browser.

## ✅ Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/renskie07/IAS-PROJECT-NEU
   ```

2. **Click on "Settings"** (at the top of the repository)

3. **Scroll down and click "Pages"** (in the left sidebar)

4. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Under **"Source"**, select:
     - Branch: **`main`**
     - Folder: **`/ (root)`**
   - Click **"Save"**

5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub to build your site

6. **Your website will be live at:**
   ```
   https://renskie07.github.io/IAS-PROJECT-NEU/
   ```

## 🎉 That's It!

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, you can:
- Share the link with anyone
- View your portfolio online
- Access it from any device

## 📝 Important Notes

- ✅ Your `index.html` is already in the root directory (perfect!)
- ✅ All your files are properly linked
- ✅ The website is ready to go live

## 🛠️ Need Help?

If the site doesn't appear after 5-10 minutes:
1. Make sure the repository is **Public** (or you have GitHub Pro)
2. Double-check the branch is set to **`main`**
3. Verify the folder is set to **`/ (root)`**
