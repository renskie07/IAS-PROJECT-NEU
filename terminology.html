                        <p class="term-definition">
                            The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to prevent unauthorized access. Only authorized parties 
                            with the decryption key can read the original information. Encryption is fundamental to protecting data both 
                            at rest (stored data) and in transit (data being transmitted over networks). Modern encryption algorithms use 
                            mathematical functions to transform data in ways that are computationally infeasible to reverse without the key.

                            A network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an 
                            organization's previously established security policies. Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal 
                            networks and untrusted external networks (such as the Internet). They can be hardware-based, software-based, 
                            or a combination of both, and use rules to allow or block traffic based on source, destination, protocol, 
                            port, and content.

                            Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise computer systems. Includes viruses, 
                            worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can be delivered through various vectors including email 
                            attachments, malicious websites, infected software, or removable media. It may steal sensitive information, 
                            damage systems, disrupt operations, or provide unauthorized access to attackers.

                            Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Common 
                            techniques include phishing, pretexting, and baiting. Unlike technical attacks that exploit software 
                            vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits human psychology and trust. Attackers often impersonate trusted 
                            individuals or organizations to trick victims into revealing passwords, transferring funds, or installing 
                            malicious software.

                        <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-check"></i> Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
                        <p class="term-definition">
                            An authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access 
                            to a resource such as an application or online account. Factors typically fall into three categories: 
                            something you know (password), something you have (security token or smartphone), and something you are 
                            (biometric data like fingerprints). MFA significantly enhances security by adding layers of protection 
                            beyond just passwords.

                        <p class="term-definition">
                            The assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something. In digital security, it provides proof 
                            of the origin and integrity of data. Non-repudiation ensures that a party cannot later deny having sent a 
                            message or performed an action. This is typically achieved through digital signatures, which use cryptographic 
                            techniques to bind a message to its sender and provide evidence that the message hasn't been altered.

                        <p class="term-definition">
                            A security principle where users are granted the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to 
                            perform their job functions. This principle limits the potential damage that can result from accidents, 
                            errors, or malicious actions. By restricting access rights, organizations can reduce the attack surface 
                            and prevent users from accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions beyond their role 
                            requirements.

                        <p class="term-definition">
                            A software vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor or for which no patch is available. Attackers can 
                            exploit zero-day vulnerabilities before developers can fix them, making them particularly dangerous. The 
                            term "zero-day" refers to the fact that developers have had zero days to address the vulnerability. These 
                            vulnerabilities are highly valued by attackers and can cause significant damage before they are discovered 
                            and patched.

                        Mastery of information security terminology is essential for effective communication and understanding in the 
                        field of cybersecurity. These terms form the foundation of security discussions and are used across various 
                        contexts including policy development, risk assessment, incident response, and security architecture.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        Each term represents a critical concept that security professionals must understand to design, implement, and 
                        maintain effective security programs. As the field continues to evolve, new terminology emerges, but these 
                        fundamental terms remain central to information assurance and security practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When studying these terms, consider their practical applications and how they relate to real-world security 
                        scenarios. Understanding the context and implications of each term will help you make informed security 
                        decisions and communicate effectively with other professionals in the field.
